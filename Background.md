# Protection of Oceans, Seas, and Marine Resources for Sustainable Development

An analysis of Goal 14 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which focuses on conserving the oceans, seas, and marine resources to ensure their long-term health and sustainability with a major focus on the European Region. The oceans incorporate over 70% of the Earth's surface and play an important role in climate regulation, food production, and supporting millions of livelihoods. 
Oceans, seas, and coastal areas are crucial parts of our planet. They cover over two-thirds of Earth's surface and hold 97% of its water. Protecting them is essential for our future.

## Problem

Oceans, seas, and marine resources are increasingly threatened, degraded, or destroyed by human activities, reducing their ability to provide crucial ecosystem services. The benefits provided by oceans, seas and marine resources are important to all people, the poor, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups. Today we are faced with an ocean emergency with problems such as ocean eutrophication which refers to algal blooms and dead zones in oceans, ocean acidification which is 30% higher than in pre-industrial times, ocean warming, plastic pollution and overfishing. 
With this study we aim to understand how to best preserve our blue waters as is the need to safeguard the planets largest ecosystem looking at data generally from the European Region and mostly Euopean Union countries. 

## Significance of the Study

The importance of this study is crucial for the following reasons:

1. The study highlights the need for international cooperation to solve transnational issues like overfishing and ocean pollution. To create and enforce laws that reduce environmental damage and ensure the prudent use of marine resources, governments, organizations, and communities must collaborate.

2. Global food security, biodiversity, and climate regulation all depend on healthy seas. Coastal protection, carbon storage, and the provision of habitat for numerous species are all facilitated by marine ecosystems such as seagrass beds, mangroves, and coral reefs. By preserving these ecosystems, we can make sure they will continue to provide these essential services and promote the wellbeing of the world.
   
3. Marine life is seriously threatened by pollution, especially plastic trash. This study promotes more robust approaches to reducing marine pollution, such as better waste management systems, less plastic manufacture and use, and trash cleaning. Reducing pollution will enhance water quality for human and marine life, safeguard biodiversity, and help avoid harm to marine animals
   
4. Oceans absorb a large quantity of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to mitigate climate change. Maintaining marine ecosystems aids in adapting to climate change because robust seas are better able to control temperatures, absorb surplus heat, and offer resilience in the face of extreme weather. By preserving these ecosystems, coastal areas are less affected by the effects of sea level rise.
   
5. Marine environments and fish supplies have been damaged by overfishing and unsustainable practices. In order to support fish population regeneration and maintain marine resources for future generations, the research advocates for sustainable fisheries management, which includes marine protected areas, fishing limits, and alternative livelihoods.

6. Understanding ecosystems and tackling ocean concerns need research in marine science and cutting-edge technology. Eco-friendly shipping and conservation tools are examples of sustainable technology that can enhance the preservation of marine resources and promote sustainable enterprises.

## Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1.	Enable fishing without the fear of extinction of certain species caused by overfishing.

2.	Reduce the pollution of marine ecosystems and conserve coastal and marine areas to conserve biodiversity.

3.	Work on restoring marine and coastal ecosystems to keep them healthy and productive.

4.	Encourage more research in marine technology and how it can lead to efficient and better ways to track information and lead to better use of resources.

5.	Reduce acidity levels in the ocean by implementing measures to reduce the acidity levels.
