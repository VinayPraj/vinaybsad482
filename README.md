# Protection of Oceans, Seas, and Marine Resources for Sustainable Development

*By: Vinay Prajapati*
## Executive Summary
Goal 14 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to protect oceans, seas, and marine resources. Oceans cover 70% of Earth, regulating climate, providing food, and supporting jobs. However, pollution, overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change threaten these ecosystems, which many vulnerable communities depend on. Protecting them is crucial for both ecological and economic stability.

## Key Performance Indicators

1. Marine Protected Area Coverage Rate
- This KPI identifies the protected areas based on the region which help to know the most and least protected regions in Europe.
- Target: To prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution in particular land-based activities by 2025.
- Frequnecy: Annually 

2. Ocean Acidity Reduction
- Addressing ocean acidity is important as the more marine waters become acidic it will harm aquatic life and lead to destroying of life under water.
- The decline in the pH level  means the marine water is getting more acidic and the invrease in the pH level would mean less acid in the water.
- Target: By 2030, reduce and mitigate the effects of ocean acidification, especially by strengthening collaboration among scientists at all levels.
- Frequency: Annually

3. Water Quality
- Addressing this KPI is crucial to know the quality of water and how clean it is and wheather it is harming the auqatic life or not underwater.
- This helps us classify the inland and marine bathing waters as poor, good or excellent.
-Range: 1%-100%
- Frequency: Annual

4. Sustainable levels of Fish Stock
-  This KPI helps informs us of the amount of fish stock and species avaialble for sustainable fishing w=as overfishing will lead to extinction of some species.
-  Target: To regukate the level of fishing and end illegal, overfishing and unregulated fishing and poor fishing practices by 2030.
-  Frequnecy: Annual

6. Marine Pollution Reduction
- Addressing marine pollution supports the sustainability of fisheries by protecting fish stocks and aquatic habitats, ensuring that fishing communities can thrive
economically while maintaining ecological integrity.
- The Index of coastal eutrophication; and plastic waste cleaned from oceans.
- Target: By 2025, prevent and drastically reduce marine pollution of all kinds, especially from land-based activities, such as nutrient pollution and marine 
  debris.
- Range: 1%-100%
- Frequency: Annual

# Analysis

## Countries with the most Protected Surface Area
![Picture](Presentation/fig1.png)
The above image illustrates that France has the most protected surface areas in Europe compared to other countries.

## Global PH Level
![Picture](Presentation/fig2.png)
The above line grapgh shows that the PH level has been steadily declining from 1985 to 2022. This means the acidity level of the water has been increasing slowly in the European Regions.

## Countries with Clean Coastal Water

According to the data analyzed as illustrated above it shows Cyprus as the country with the most clean water from 2011 to 2023 with an average higher than other countries through out this period.

## Fish Stock with Sustainable levels

The line grapgh above shows Fish stock on a rapid decline form 2003 to 2022 from the Atlantic, NorthEast and Mediterranean and Black Sea.
 
## Countries With Most Marine Pollution

 The region with the most marine pollution is Jordan which is indicated by the larger circle according to the world data from 2005 to 2022.
